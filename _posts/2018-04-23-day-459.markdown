1/ **Trump's new national security adviser chaired a nonprofit that promoted misleading and anti-Muslim news**. Bolton was chairman of the Gatestone Institute from 2013 until last month. The advocacy group claims that a "jihadist takeover" of Europe is leading to a "Great White Death," which was amplified by a Russian troll factory that sought to portray Western society as at risk of "Islamization." ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/john-bolton-chaired-anti-muslim-think-tank-n868171))

2/ **The Trump administration challenges that Native Americans are not exempt from new Medicaid work rules because it would be illegal preferential treatment**. Meaning, Native Americans would need to get a job if they want to keep their health care. The administration has allowed three states – Arkansas, Kentucky and Indiana – to begin instituting Medicaid work requirements, and at least 10 other states have submitted or are preparing applications.

3/ **The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will vote on Mike Pompeo's nomination for secretary of state today**. All 10 Democrats and Rand Paul have announced their opposition to Pompeo's nomination. Mitch McConnell is expected to bring up Pompeo's nomination for a floor vote later in the week, which is expected to be close. Pompeo can receive at most 49 Republican votes with Paul already a "no" and John McCain absent due to illness. Trump tweeted that it's "hard to believe Obstructionists May vote against Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State," claiming Democrats "will not approve hundreds of good people" by "maxing out" the confirmation process.

4/ **Trump rejected speculation that Michael Cohen will flip**, tweeting that he has "always liked and respected" his attorney. He added that "Most people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble, even if it means lying or making up stories. Sorry, I don't see Michael doing that despite the horrible Witch Hunt and the dishonest media!" In a flurry of weekend tweets, Trump called New York Times journalist [Maggie Haberman](https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/) a "third rate reporter" and a Clinton "flunkie" following her [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/us/politics/trump-michael-cohen.html) that Cohen could end up cooperating with federal officials as legal fees and possible criminal charges pile up.

* **Hillary Clinton: The First Amendment is "under open assault" in the Trump era**. "We are living through an all-out war on truth, facts and reason," Clinton said. "When leaders deny things we can see with our own eyes, like the size of a crowd at the inauguration, when they refuse to accept settled science when it comes to urgent challenges like climate change ... it is the beginning of the end of freedom, and that is not hyperbole. It’s what authoritarian regimes through history have done."

6/ **Kellyanne Conway accused CNN of sexism for asking about her husband's critical Trump tweets**. Conway said CNN's Dana Bash question "was meant to harass and embarrass," which was inappropriate and created a "double standard." Conway's husband, George Conway, has been by tweeting and retweeting critical comments about Trump, but recently deleted a handful of tweets last month. ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/384319-conway-lashes-out-at-cnn-for-question-about-husbands-tweets) / [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/22/kellyanne-conway-dana-bash-cnn-545220) / [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/22/politics/kellyanne-conway-george-conway-tweets-cnntv/index.html))

On MSNBC's "Morning Joe," Mika Brzezinski called Trump's tweets \
"especially insulting to the United States of America" on a day "the world said goodbye to Barbara Bush." ([The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/media/384403-morning-joe-host-trump-tweeting-during-barbara-bush-funeral-was-insulting-to))

8/ **Trump's legislative affairs director won't rule out Trump firing Robert Mueller or Rod Rosenstein**, saying the special counsel has moved outside his original mandate. Marc Short said: "We believe the scope has gone well beyond what was intended to be Russian meddling in the election," adding that "We don't know how far off the investigation is going to veer."
